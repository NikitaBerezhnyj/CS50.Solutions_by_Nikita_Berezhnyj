# CS50 Solutions by Nikita Berezhnyj

The **CS50** course is one of the most popular online courses in computer science fundamentals offered by Harvard University. The course covers a wide range of topics including programming, algorithms, data structures, databases, operating systems, networks, and web development.

I was very interested in this course, so I decided to do assignments from it to improve my own skills. I will upload the results of my solutions to this GitHub repository.
